During coding tasks, I have used Github copilot integration in VS Code and Claude Sonnet 4 model for:
- Understanding the `request` parameter in config fixture 
- Understand what `config.option` relates to command line parameter ( eg. `config.option.reruns` vs cli `--reruns 5` )
- Understand how to unbloc execution test thread when generating the Allure report ( using `threading` )

During merge I have used Github Copilot for:
- PR summary 
- Code review
